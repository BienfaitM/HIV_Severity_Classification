<Description of dataset> 

* There are all five tables(or files) in a dataset.
* The date of genotype was used as a baseline and all the fields providing date information  contain the number of weeks from the baseline.

TABLE RX.txt

DESCRIPTION
	This file contains a list of regimens for each patient who enrolled the study.

FIELD DESCRIPTION
	PtID -- a patient identifier
	Alias -- a patient name alias
	ExactDateUnknown -- "No" if the exact dates of start and stop of a regimen are known and the StartDate and StopDate columns contain the exact dates
			    "Yes" if the exact dates of start and stop of a regimen are not known and StartDate and StopDate columns contain made-up dates
	DrugOrderUnknown -- "No" if the drugs in a regimen are known to be taken at the same time
			    "Yes" if the combination of drugs taken at the same time or the order of drugs taken is not known 
	StartDate -- date of start of a regimen (number of weeks from the baseline)
	StopDate -- date of stop of a regimen (number of weeks from the baseline)
	List of Drugs  -- "1" if a regimen contains the corresponding drug or "0" otherwise. 
                       -- if the column 'PI', 'NRTI' or 'NNRTI' has a value '1', the patient had a drug in the corresponding ARV class but the name of drug is not known


FORMAT	Each field is delimited by a tab.
